<h2>Podd version 1.7.0</h2>

16 November 2021
<p>
  The Hall A software team is pleased to present version 1.7 of the Hall A
  data analysis software Podd. This release includes three years of development,
  updates, performance improvements and bugfixes.

<p>
  The main improvements in this release are in the decoder, which now supports
  the CODA 3 raw data format, bank data and event block decoding. The EVIO
  library, used for reading CODA data, has been upgraded to version 5.3, which
  offers much better performance. Support has been added to the main detector
  classes for decoding FADC frontend modules. Additionally, there is a new module
  type, InterStageModule, which can be used to combine information from arbitrary
  detectors after each processing stage, for example to correct for trigger
  jitter in coincidence data and many other possible uses.

<p>
  The code base has been thoroughly modernized and reorganized. A C++11 compiler
  and ROOT&nbsp;6 are now required. CMake support has been added.

<p>
  Several parts of the programming interface have changed in this release
  compared to version 1.6. As a result, libraries and plug-ins will have to be
  recompiled. In some cases, minor source code changes may be necessary.

<h3>What's new</h3>
Compared to
<a href="https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/podd/wiki/Release_Notes_v16">Release 1.6</a>,
the following features have been added:

<ul>
  <li>Support for input files with CODA version 3 format has been added. The data
    format is normally automatically detected, but can be manually set if necessary.
  <li>The raw event buffer size is now dynamically adjusted based on the event
    size encountered in the input data (up to a sanity limit of 1&nbsp;GiB/event).
  <li>The automatically downloaded version of
    <a href="https://coda.jlab.org/drupal/content/event-io-evio">EVIO</a>
    has been upgraded to Release 5.3. This version includes many bug fixes
    and important performance improvements over the previous version 4.4.6.
    If you build the analyzer against a standalone version of EVIO below 5.3,
    it is strongly recommended upgrading it to 5.3.
  <li>The decoder was refactored to use unsigned 32-bit integers instead of signed integers
    for most data, which is the appropriate type for this information and consistent
    with the CODA raw data format. This change in particular may require some refactoring
    of user code.
  <li>Arbitrary configuration strings can be passed to instances of decoder modules
    via the crate map.
  <li>Support for the JLab 12 GeV pipelined electronics modules, in particular the
     FADC250, has been greatly improved. Decoders FADC-based readouts have been added
     to all standard detector classes. It is recommended to study the
    <a href="https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/podd/wiki/FADCDecoders">FADC decoder
      documentation</a> to take full advantage of this feature.
  <li>A new analysis object type,
    <a href="https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/podd/wiki/InterStageModule"><code>InterStageModule</code></a>,
    can be used to combine information from arbitrary modules (detector, spectrometers)
    after each processing stage. An example application of this module type,
    <code>HallA::TwoarmVDCTimeCorrection</code>, is included. It allows correction
    of time jitter in VDC TDCs in one spectrometer in case of a coincidence trigger
    whose timing is defined by the opposite coincidence arms.
  <li>Support for <a href="https://cmake.org"><code>CMake</code></a>
    (version 3.5 or higher) has been added to the build system.
    This is the preferred method for
  <a href="https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/podd/wiki/Installation">building the analyzer</a>.
    The previous <code>SCons</code> system is still available but deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. The plain <code>Makefile</code> build system has been
    removed.
  <li>The <code>CMake</code> system automatically sets <code>RPATH</code> in the resulting
    binaries on all supported platforms, which should greatly reduce errors due to
    an incorrectly set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
  <li>Support for shell
    <a href="https://redmine.jlab.org/projects/podd/wiki/EnvModules">environment modules</a>
    has been added. Additionally, traditional environment setup scripts for
    <code>sh/bash</code> and <code>csh/tcsh</code> are installed along with the analyzer
    binaries.
  <li>System requirements now include ROOT&nbsp;6 and a C++11 compiler.
  <li>Supported macOS versions include 10.12 (Sierra) through 11 (Big Sur)
    with the matching command line tools for Xcode, which provide Apple Clang&nbsp;9.0
    through 13.0. A full installation of Xcode is not required.
  <li>The code base has been thoroughly modernized to C++11 (or C++14/C++17, if available).
    Many suggestions from static code analyzers
    (<code>cppcheck</code>, <code>clang-tidy</code>, Coverity Scan)
    have been incorporated for better code safety and portability.
  <li>Support functions for the text-based database system have been refactored into
    a separate standalone library <code>libPoddDB</code> which can be linked with
    arbitrary user projects independent of Podd.
</ul>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
Version 1.7 is neither completely source-compatible nor binary-compatible with version 1.6 and
prior releases. Plug-ins and user libraries will need to be recompiled and possibly
changed. Any required changes will probably be relatively minor, however.
Please contact the developers if you need to do this and run into problems.

<h3>Minimum system requirements & dependencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linux with gcc/g++&nbsp;4.8 or higher; or macOS&nbsp;10.12 or higher with Apple's
    command line tools for Xcode (providing clang/clang++&nbsp;9.0 or higher). The compiler
    must support C++11.
  <li>ROOT&nbsp;6. Latest version recommended.
  <li>CMake&nbsp;3.5. Version 3.15 or newer recommended.
  <li>Reasonably powerful hardware (2&nbsp;GHz multicore CPU, 2&nbsp;GB RAM).
    Runtime resource requirements are highly dependent on the analysis configuration
    and the complexity of the input data.
</ul>
The following platforms have been explicitly tested:
<ul>
  <li>RedHat Enterprise Linux&nbsp;7 and 8
  <li>Fedora&nbsp;32 and 34
  <li>Ubuntu&nbsp;20.04&nbsp;LTS
  <li>macOS&nbsp;10.12, 10.15 and 11.3
</ul>
Other Unix-like platforms that support ROOT and CMake should work as well,
likely out of the box.
